This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Live at [https://leapin.vercel.app/](https://leapin.vercel.app/)

## General idea

- Building calendly react components from scratch.
- Use google calendar api to fetch booked events and book new events.

## Improvents

- Cut off time bug - there's no cut off time logic for now for time slot, only cut off time for days
- Invalidate query bug - queries should be reset after booking a meeting, so that the time slots picker can reflect the actual available slots.
- We can make the React components more generic, surface more props out.
- Add Unit tests.
- Time slot filtering algorithm can be improved.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
